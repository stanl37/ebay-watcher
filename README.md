# ebay-watcher
A script that adds to the "Watch" counter on an eBay listing. Makes the listing seem more popular, which affects the eBay search algorithm and may increase real visitors to the listing, increase the listing's ranking in search results, and emulating high demand for the listing.

## imports and modules
Custom files I've created with default/commonly used functions/packages that I choose to include in most of my scripts to make development easier.
